My name is Vinit Khandagle. I am Systems Engineer working in the Site reliability and Devops space. I practice  and apply strong technical, functional and analytical skills and operate with a strong sense of urgency which helps me thrive in fast paced settings in order to solve business problems and build a strong bridge between Business and technical requirements. 

Being a person who acquired his knowledge in business studies, I always had an inclination towards technology and system administration. The love for tinkering with systems and computers in general, catapulted to great heights, with immense love and curiosity, when I was introduced to Linux, Opensource and the Free Software movement. The sheer dedication of all the stallwarts in these movements and their contribution to shape the very fabric of the internet and introduce freedom and openness to software development and distribution drove my passion and my professional career. Be it Linus creating the Linux Kernel or Richard Stallman writing the gcc complier and emacs or even just reading Eric Raymond's book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" shaped my thinking and attitude towards creating a free and open platform for everyone. 

Fast forward to the present. I now see a world of information that is highly regulated and in a way being centralized within the giant companies of the world with the likes of "Google", "Facebook" and "Amazon" to name a few. This movement of centralized control of data, which ideally was never the intention of building the web, drove me towards trying to understand what would it take to have a fair and ethical decentralized trusted network of information and data. 

This curiosity and quest to understand the immense benefits of decentralized network of applications and information pushed me towards adapting and learning WEB 3.0. I firmly believe that there is a dire need for the internet to evolve and fundamentally adapt to operate on neutral, decentralized protocols and applications and I see that Protocol Labs as a company is leading the pathway in building the internet of tomorrow with technologies like Web 3.0, IPFS for storing data using the blockchain technologies and providing a stake for everyone who share their data on this network through cryptocurrency like Filecoin. 

I am so intrigued by these new technology platforms and the operational mechanism and would love to see more application adapt and build upon them.
